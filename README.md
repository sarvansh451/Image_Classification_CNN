# Image_Classification_CNN
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying images of dogs and cats. The model is trained on a dataset containing images of both dog and cat categories, and its goal is to accurately distinguish between the two based on visual features in the images. The CNN architecture consists of several convolutional layers to automatically extract features from the images, followed by pooling layers to reduce the spatial dimensions and prevent overfitting. The final layers include fully connected layers, and the model uses a softmax activation function to output a probability distribution for the two classes: dog and cat. The model is trained using backpropagation with optimization techniques like Adam. Once trained, the model is capable of classifying new images of dogs and cats with high accuracy, demonstrating the power of CNNs for image classification tasks.
